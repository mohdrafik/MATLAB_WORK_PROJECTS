Matlab_projects : here All work  and Projects related to the matlab 
 this is related to the selcet particular desiraed peaks from the multiple peak data (RAMAN SPECTROSCOPY).
 After selecting the desired peak, fit them using inbuilt function "lorentzfit.m" just give here your x and y data by the default it will fit it.
 and return the peak ampltiude and corresponding x value at peak and FWHM and constant (c - like base offset) in the parameter "PARAM = [P1 P2 P3 C]".
 then we fit plot the and mark the peak and fwhm and create the file where we can write our required important parameters.
 for futher processing and comparing with other Raman spectroscopy peak at the same x position at different voltage.
